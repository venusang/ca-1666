                <h2>Tea with Grandma</h2> <p>by A.P. Raj</p>
               
                <p>
                <img src="images/teawithgrandma.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="left" />
                Ravi loved to talk to his Grandma, who lived in India. Grandma had grown up in a small village called Tambaram, and had lived there her whole life. Sometimes Ravi got to visit her with his mom and dad and his sisters. Grandma would make him tea and tell him stories about when she was growing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ravi grew up in Texas, so Grandma’s stories were very interesting to him. She lived in a different world. Grandma went to the temple. Ravi went to the church. Ravi was frightened by insects, but Grandma was not even scared of snakes. When he went on walks with her, Ravi was not afraid either.
                When Ravi was younger, Grandma would often come to visit him in Texas. But now it was harder for her to travel, so she stayed at home. He missed her visits. Sometimes she would call on the phone. Grandma always called late at night. Dad explained to Ravi that when it was nighttime in Texas, it was daytime in India. Ravi loved hearing her voice on the phone. He would always ask Grandma if she would make him a cup of tea. She would always laugh and say, “Ravi, sweetheart, I can send you my voice, but not my tea.”
                </p>
                <p>
                One night, Ravi’s grandmother didn’t call. His mom and dad called him into the living room. They were sitting in front of a laptop, and asked him to come sit with them and look at the screen. Grandma was there, and she was drinking a cup of tea. She smiled at Ravi.
                “Hello, dear!” she said to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ravi’s dad got up and went into the kitchen. Grandma asked Ravi a lot of questions, like she always did. She asked how he was doing in school. She asked how his friends were. She asked what he liked to do for fun. Ravi answered her questions and asked some of his own. He asked if Grandma still liked to go for walks to the temple. She said she did. Then he smiled and asked, “Grandma, can I have a sip of your tea?”
                Ravi felt a tap on his shoulder, and his dad set down a steaming cup in front of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                “We know how much you love to have tea with Grandma,” his dad said. “Just be careful not to spill it.” His dad smiled.
                Ravi laughed and drank his tea with Grandma. His mom took a picture of him and the computer. The picture made Ravi happy, and he put it on his wall. Later, his mom showed him how to email the picture to Grandma and to his friends. Ravi was glad he could send pictures and words and voices. But he still hoped Grandma could send him some tea one day.
